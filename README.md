# RoloBox
RoloBox is my capstone project during my study in [UWL](https://www.uwlax.edu/), it has been moved offline after I completed my project presentation. If you would like to see the demo, go to [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/bv1q54y1i7nr).

The project has been divided into three parts:
- [rolobox-node](https://github.com/greenlihui/rolobox-node)
- [rolobox-angular](https://github.com/greenlihui/rolobox-angular)
- [rolobox-flutter](https://github.com/greenlihui/rolobox-flutter)

This repository is the mobile part of RoloBox, written with Flutter.

More details about rolobox can be found in [rolobox-node](https://github.com/greenlihui/rolobox-node)
